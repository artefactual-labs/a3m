============
Installation
============

a3m is available in PyPI, a software repository for Python projects::

    pip install a3m

We also publish a Docker image that bundles all software dependencies that a3m
needs for a good out-of-box experience. This image is public and can be pulled
from the command line with::

    docker pull ghcr.io/artefactual-labs/a3m:latest

If you don't want to use Docker, it is still possible to run a3m successfully
as long as the software dependencies are provided in some other way. Please
continue reading.
